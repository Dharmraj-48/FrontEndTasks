            <p>Various educators teach rules governing the length of paragraphs.
                They may say that a paragraph should be 100 to 200 words long, or be no more than five or six sentences.

                The true measure of your paragraphs should be ideas.</p>

            <p>The fact of the matter is that although you may have numerous valid facts or descriptions related to your
             paragraph’s core idea, you may lose a reader’s attention if your paragraphs are too long. What’s more,
